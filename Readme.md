## Overview
This **AI-powered stock price predictor** combines **fast forecasting** with **deep learning** to deliver accurate and explainable market insights.

Built in **MATLAB**, the tool features two models:
- ‚ö° **Baseline Forecast (Quick-Cycle Model):** For fast short-term predictions.
- ü§ñ **AI-Refined Forecast (Constructive MLP):** An adaptive neural network that grows dynamically to capture complex market patterns.

The system ingests historical price data, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors to predict future movements while adapting to **changing market regimes**.

**Key benefits:**
- Prevents overfitting by adding neurons **only when validation improves**.
- Uses **second-order optimization** for faster, more reliable training.
- Provides **explainability** by highlighting the most important features driving predictions.
- Offers **real-time APIs** for trading, robo-advisors, and risk management.

---

### Problem
Stock price prediction is challenging due to:
- **Non-stationary, noisy data** with regime shifts.
- Traditional models (ARIMA, GARCH, etc.) capturing only limited patterns.
- Off-the-shelf AI models often being **black-boxes**, prone to overfitting, and ignoring intraday context.

**Market needs:**  
‚úÖ A robust, **explainable engine** that:
- Learns changing regimes automatically.
- Ingests price/volume data plus macro factors.
- Delivers both fast baseline forecasts and **deeper AI insights**.

---

### Solution & Approach
Two complementary forecasting pipelines inside MATLAB:

1. **Baseline Forecast (Quick-Cycle)**
    - Lightweight regression/ARIMA variant.
    - Delivers instant, low-latency predictions for short-term decisions.
    - Serves as a benchmark for AI improvements.

2. **AI-Refined Forecast (Constructive MLP)**
    - Grows hidden neurons sequentially until validation error no longer improves.
    - Trained with **Hessian-based Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer** for stability.
    - Captures nonlinear dependencies and **market regime shifts** automatically.

Both pipelines share:
- Common feature engineering.
- Rolling-window validation.
- Standardized error tracking for fair A/B testing.

---

### Key Achievements
- üìâ **7‚Äì12% lower RMSE** vs tuned ARIMA on S&P 500 back-tests.
- ‚ö° **<120ms latency** for baseline, **<350ms** for AI model (CPU).
- üß† **Constructive MLP** prevents overfitting via adaptive growth.
- üîç **Explainability built-in:** Hessian sensitivity analysis surfaces top 15 features per prediction.

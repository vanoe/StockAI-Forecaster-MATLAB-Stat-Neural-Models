## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Description

This AI-powered stock predictor combines **fast forecasting** with **deep learning** to give investors and analysts more accurate and explainable market insights.

- **Baseline Model:** Quick short-term forecasts for intraday or daily decisions.
- **AI-Refined Neural Network:** Adaptive MLP that grows automatically to learn complex market patterns.
- **Explainable Predictions:** Highlights which features matter most.

It uses historical price data, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors to forecast future movements while adapting to changing market regimes.

## üîç Problem Solved

Stock price prediction is challenging because markets are:

- **Non-stationary & noisy**
- **Influenced by technical, fundamental, and behavioral factors**
- **Prone to regime shifts**

Traditional models (ARIMA, GARCH) capture only linear patterns, while many AI approaches:

- Overfit easily
- Lack transparency
- Ignore intraday or regime changes

Investors need a robust, **explainable engine** that:

- Ingests historical price/volume + optional macro factors
- Learns changing market regimes automatically
- Provides both fast forecasts and deeper AI-refined outlooks

## üí° Solution & Overall Approach

We built **two complementary pipelines in MATLAB**:

1. **Baseline Forecast (Current-Cycle):**
    - Lightweight statistical learner
    - Immediate next-period prediction
    - Perfect for intraday/daily decisions

2. **AI-Refined Forecast:**
    - Constructive Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    - Architecture grows automatically until validation error stops improving
    - Hessian-based optimizer fine-tunes weights for fast convergence
    - Captures nonlinear dependencies & regime shifts without manual tuning

Both pipelines share:

- Feature engineering
- Rolling-window validation
- Standardized error tracking

## üèÜ Key Achievements

- **7‚Äì12% lower RMSE** vs tuned ARIMA on S&P 500 (3-year rolling back-tests)
- **Fast inference:** <120 ms (baseline) & <350 ms (AI-refined)
- Constructive MLP scales automatically, preventing overfitting
- Hessian-based sensitivity analysis identifies **top 15 influential features**

## üß† Training Process Highlights

**Pre-processing:**

- Align OHLCV to uniform timestamps
- Forward-fill gaps & remove outliers
- Generate log returns + 20+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, ATR, etc.)
- Optional macro factors (Fed rate, VIX, CPI surprises)

**Model Selection & Growth:**

- Start with single hidden unit
- Add neurons greedily using **constructive learning**
- Fine-tune using **Levenberg-Marquardt + Hessian**

**Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning:**

- Nested walk-forward cross-validation
- Dynamic early stopping based on recent 5-window std deviation

**Deployment:**

- MATLAB ‚Üí compiled C++ library
- REST micro-service: `/forecast/current` & `/forecast/refined`
- Canary release monitors live MAE drift, auto-retrain if drift > 1.5√ó stdev
